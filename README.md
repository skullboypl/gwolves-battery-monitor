# 🖱️ G-Wolves Battery Monitor

A lightweight Python tray utility that displays the **battery percentage of your G-Wolves Fenrir Max 8K (and similar WebHID mice)**.  
It uses **Playwright** to open [mouse.xyz](https://mouse.xyz), automatically connects to your dongle via the HID picker, and shows the current battery level in the system tray.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🟢 Auto-detects and connects to your mouse via WebHID
- ⏱️ Refreshes battery level every 10 minutes
- 🖼️ Minimal tray icon with percentage text
- 🌑 Chromium runs in dark mode, hidden after connection
- 💾 Persistent Chromium profile in  
  `C:\ProgramData\GwovesBatteryChromium` (remembers HID permission)
